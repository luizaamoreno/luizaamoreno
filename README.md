## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently completing my studies in Full Stack Programming at Infinity School in Fortaleza, Brazil. I've always been passionate about technology and related fields. While I already possessed design skills, last year I decided to challenge myself by learning something new. ðŸ¤“ <br>
So, here I am. âœ¨ <br>
My core strengths lie in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a deep love for learning and exploring new possibilities in the world of programming. Currently, I'm working on developing a Point of Sale (POS) system for a mini-market. This project includes features such as inventory management, order processing, and a dashboard that displays key information about inventory levels and sales data.
